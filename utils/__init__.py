# Import necessary modules
from . import db_api # Import the database API module, which likely contains functions for interacting with a database
from . import misc # Import the miscellaneous utility module, which may contain various helper functions
from .notify_admins import on_startup_notify # Import the on\_startup\_notify function from the notify\_admins module, which is likely used to send a notification to administrators when the program starts

# The above code block imports three modules using the "from ... import ..." syntax. This syntax is used when you want to import specific functions or objects from a module instead of the entire module. In this case, the code is importing the db\_api, misc, and on\_startup\_notify modules/functions. The db\_api module likely contains functions for interacting with a database, the misc module may contain various helper functions, and the on\_startup\_notify function is likely used to send a notification to administrators when the program starts.
